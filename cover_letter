To the Hiring Manager at COMPANY,

	I am writing in regard to your posting on WEBSITE seeking a new engineer to join your CITY development team. Given my bachelor’s of science in computer science and my experience working both on team driven and individual projects, I believe I am an ideal candidate for this position.

	I have experience in front-end web and back-end development through Angular 2 and Node.js, Java, SQL and NoSQL database management, and mobile applications development – all skills your listing either said you were seeking from a new hire or which I believe would be of great use to the company moving forward. Beyond this I have an immense desire to learn and develop as an engineer, and I am enthusiastic to work with any and all languages or technical tools that might be needed.

	In addition to my technical skills, I have impeccable written and verbal communications skills. I believe the skills that I developed in my undergraduate and graduate programs in English will allow me to satisfy any in-house technical writing duties or detailed documentation needs that might arise. 

	As requested, I have attached a copy of my resume for your perusal. Also, I am willing and able to relocate immediately as may be needed.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

James Hood
